# About the project

In this project, we are interested in different aspects of the World Happiness report and asking further questions regarding them.
We are going to collect data on the world happiness index, GDP of countries , life expectancy, trust in government , generosity etc. and try to find correlations between these and the happiness index. Also we will use other parameters in the dataset like poverty index and Literacy rate, and compare them with the other factors of the world happiness report, to see whether they are significantt enough tp be included in the report at all.
